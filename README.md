# Mycodingproject

Hi guys! This Git Repositary stores all of the files relevant to my Code Project

My final Code Project is a 75 second song I created using Sonic Pi and you can find it via the file named: Tahni's Final Sonic Pi Code Project.rb 

To listen to my song, download Sonic Pi and copy and paste the lines of code into that computer program and then press run 

I was inspired by the genres of afropop, R&B and house music in the creation of my project and some of my favourite songs which provided me with inspiration can be found via the file named: Spotify inspiration.png which is a screenshot of my playlist on spotify I made

Sonic Pi uses the coding language Ruby, and my song incorpoates different samples, beats, bass sounds and tabla drum sounds. 

Other important files for my tutor to view is:

File name: Bank of codes.docx - I created this bank of codes during my progress of developing my project. It holds all of the neccesary codes I learnt when interacting with tutorials, resources, websites and Youtube videos. It also has my own definition of their functions for me to easily understand which I referred back to while I was creating my final project. 

File names: 
Levi Niha's Youtube video: Making Music with Code (Using Sonic Pi)
Linda O Keeffe's Tutorials via Wismos website
Mister Bomb's Youtube video: Sonic Pi Tutorial - Using Loop Samples
Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s tutorials
- These are some of the tutorials, websites and Youtube videos I viewed, watched and progressed through which taught me lessons regarding how to use Sonic Pi and the program's codes 

File name:
Twinkle Twinkle Little star .rb - This is my experimentation when coding the song Twinkle Twinkle Little Star using Sonic Pi




FYI - All the other files store progress, practice songs and screenshots of important information I wanted to keep for myself.
